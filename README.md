Coded for Paradiso Amsterdam

For use with the Conceptinetics DMX Isolated shield.

This piece of code has been designed to work with a custom made shield on top of the Conceptinetics
Shield. Refer to schematics for further info.
The main functionality of the device is listen to a defined DMX channel and connect or disconnect DMX signal to an attached device, in this case the Look Unique Hazer.

I'm using DMX library from Conceptinetics with slight modification to be compatible with the 
new Arduino IDE (attached in this repository).
