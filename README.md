Coded for Paradiso Amsterdam

For use with the Conceptinetics DMX Isolated shield.

This piece of code has been designed to work with a custome made shield on top of the Conceptinetics
Shield. Refer to schematics for further info.
The main functionality is to listen to a DMX channel and connect or disconnect DMX signal to an attached 
device, in this case th Look Unique Hazer.
Since the lack of control channel on the Unique hazer this will act as one with as less as possible
modifications on the original hardware.


I'm using DMX library from Conceptinetics with slight modification to be compatible with the 
new Arduino IDE. (attached in this repository )
